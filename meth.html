										<h3>Introduction</h3>
										<p>In a sea of crypto currency wallet apps there is a dearth of well designed UI. mETH is a concept wallet app design for the Ethereum crypto currency. 
												It has been designed for people who own Ethereum tokens, wish to keep them in a secure wallet, track the coin in the market and make transactions. 
												The app has been designed with easy and clear to use and navigation, keeping only the essential features in.
												<br>
												<br>
												The app has been designed using the Android material design guidelines. 
												The font weights and colors have been used in a way that denotes the hierarchy of information. 
												The app has been designed in a way as to organize the features to make it user friendly.
												<br>
												<br>
												mETH has four main sections, the menu, the market, the wallet and the transactions. 
												Each of these is available on the bottom navigation bar, giving the user easy access to each section.</p>

										<h3>Market Section</h3>
										<p>The market section shows a large graph that tracks the Ether and it can be filtered by time. 
												The important figures, such as live price, high price, low price and volume traded have been included as well. 
												Each price figure has been given a color and font size according to the type and importance of the information. 
												For example, the live price is the information the user would want to see first, therefore, it has been given a bigger font size and the brighter color than the rest.</p>

										<h3>Wallet Section</h3>
										<p>The Wallet section has two subsections, Assets and Transactions, which can easily be accessed from a top bar menu. 
												The yellow color and underline clearly show the user which subsection they are currently viewing. 
												The Assets page lists down all the asset names and the quantities in a scrollable page. 
												The Transactions page shows a simple list of sent and received funds, which can be expanded to see all details. 
												The current valuation of the userâ€™s holdings can always be seen clearly at the top in bold. </p>

										<h3>Transaction Section</h3>
										<p>Consistency is key in any UX/UI design. The Transactions page has some elements from the wallet page to achieve consistency. 
												The Receive subsection shows the userâ€™s wallet address in both QR and text form. 
												The user has the option to choose between wallets here from a drop-down menu. 
												The Send subsection gives the user the option of either typing in another userâ€™s address or scanning the QR Code with an inbuilt camera.</p>

											</div>
										</div>
										<h3>Menu Section</h3>
										<p> A simple slide out overlay menu was designed for this app that has all the other features listed in it. 
												They have all been listed down clearly for the ease of the user. On tapping any of these features, a small overlay menu pops up to give further options. 
												Different colors have been used to denote options that have been and have not been selected.</p>
